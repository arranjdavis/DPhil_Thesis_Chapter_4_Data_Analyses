### DESCRIPTION ###

#This script adds the country data to each parkrun (country data was taken from the URLs of parkruns online data sets).

### NOTES ###

#This script needs "parkrunlocations.csv"

#This script originally produces dupliicates.
#So, an additional script is run in order to remove these duplicates (which also existed in the original data set finishlist.csv)
#See the end of the script for duplicate information
